## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I reviewed how to use columns in css.

```html
<svg alt="" aria-hidden="true" width="17" height="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">...
```    
I learned how to use aria-hidden tags to stop screenreaders reading decoration images.
    
```css
  #colton {
    margin-top: 0vh;
  }
  #irene {
    margin-top: 4vh;
  }
  #anne {
    margin-top: 8vh;
  }
```
I used margin-top to push the purple boxes down to produce the stairs effect.


### Continued development
I want to improve my recall on basic things like how to start a flexbox etc, that I can do but often forget how to start.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools CSS columns](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp) - I referred to this several times, and I used it to build the desktop version of the site.
- [GeeksforGeeks measurement units](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-all-the-measurement-units-in-css3/?ref=rp) - This really helped me get a handle on relative units.
